> [!NOTE]
> Download the whole repository, and make sure to preserve the directory structure. The corresponding Python scripts automatically find the supporting files based on their relative repository location. The *requirements.txt* file lists the minimum prerequisites for executing these scripts. The *repository_tree.html* file provides a quick view of the directory structure.

All the code files are under the folder *Script_Bank*. The subfolder *Analysis* contains figure-generating Python scripts, and files required to produce data sets for all corresponding computational/simulation experiments. The user should mainly play with these Python files. If the user wishes to regenerate the training data for the ANN (SBI workflow), then the subfolders *Prime* and *HPC* contain the necessary files; contact us for complete instructions.

The data sets must be uncompressed, extracted, and placed under the corresponding subfolders of *Data_Bank*. Please use the data set placement guidelines as described over the following sections.

> [!WARNING]
> The simulation-inference data bank is not available from this GitHub repository. Use the links provided at the beginning of this *README* file. As of now, the complete data bank is only available by request. Please note, the complete (uncompressed) data bank is around 500 GBs.
